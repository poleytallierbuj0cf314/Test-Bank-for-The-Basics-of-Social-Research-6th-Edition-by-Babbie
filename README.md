Authors: Earl R Babbie
This thorough revision of Babbie's standard-setting text presents a succinct, straightforward introduction to the field of research methods as practiced by social scientists. Contemporary examples, such as terrorism, Alzheimer's disease, anti-gay prejudice and education, and the legalization of marijuana, introduce students to the "how-tos" and "whys" of social research methods. With increased emphasis on qualitative research and practical applications, this edition is authoritative yet student-friendly and engaging enough to help students connect the dots between the world of social research and the real world.
